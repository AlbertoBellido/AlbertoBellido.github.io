The program was built using Java libraries in a TextPad editor.\r\n\r\n### Screens\r\nA few screens were designed for the user to be able to initiate and complete the registration process as Login Screen, Create Account Screen, Course Registration Screen, Profile Screen, and Navigation Option Screen.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThanks professor Kesha Smith (@ProfessorKesha) for your guidance, and for giving me the opportunity to work with such a great team.
